### Lesson numbering
In **tut_1.1** (example) the 1<sup>st</sup> is the teaching week number; the 2<sup>nd</sup> number is the tutorial of the week (can be 1 or 2). Each tutorial has dedicated Jupyter notebook.

#### Credits
Walkthrough code-along projects are based on tutorials developed by [Jovian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDKCxebp88A) and [Dm. Kolesnikov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaK9g990Unw).

I thank [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) for unforgettable year of study, that became a great inspiration and motivation during developing this course. Some of tutorials were adopted from ML/Predictive Analytics module.
